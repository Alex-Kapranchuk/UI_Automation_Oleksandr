by flows:
1. Searching for products/adding new products in the admin page, checking that new products have been added to
main site through search
2. Adding products to the basket
3. Currency:
  - currency change on the site itself (checking that product prices have changed according to the new currency)
- Adding a new currency to the admin page - checking that the currency has been added to the main page.
- Adding new taxes (on the admin page)
(in the open map documentation itself) as they are added, you will also need to interact with the admin page
